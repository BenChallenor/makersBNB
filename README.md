# makersBNB

High-level Specification
--------

Create a platform for users to list their homes so that other users can rent them


Team approach to project
--------

#### 1 - Priorities for learning:
* Hannah - user functionality
* Hunor - a mix
* Marcus - CSS/HTML/Front-end
* Justyna - J.query
* Ben - a mix

#### 2 - Project framework:
* Model - Javascript
* View - HTML / Javascript (+ Jquery)
* Controller - Ruby (Sinatra and Rack)
* Testing - Jasmine for unit tests, Capybara for feature tests

#### 3 - How to work as a group:
* 5th person is scrum master and can rotate between pairs (organises group sessions, code reviews pull requests, writes up notes from morning and afternoon sessions).
* Scrum master rotates each day
* 2 pairs of 2 - switch pairs each day
* Use trello to manage development workflow - managed by users and overseen by scrum master
* Morning stand ups: 9:30
* Knowledge transfer sessions: 4:45
* Pairs can manage there own time throughout the day with breakse etc

User Stories
--------
Stored in Trello development workflow system (initial view stored in scrum)

### Example user stories (the rest are stored in Trello)

As a user    
So I can see what properties are available   
I want to be able to view listings without logging in   

As a user     
So that I can use the platform      
I want to be able to sign up to Makers BnB     

As a user   
So I can interact with the platform    
I want to be able to log in   

As a user   
So that others canâ€™t access my account      
I want to be able to logout   

As a user     
So that I can rent my house    
I want to be able to list a new space   

As a user   
So that I can rent out multiple houses    
I want to be able to list multiple spaces   


#### Day 2:

* Ben started digging into finding the testing framework we'll use and found mocha.
* Hunor joined into this digging in the afternoon and they found that possibly mocha and zombie would do the job for testing our full stack JavaScript application.
* Ben and Hunor got stuck on the mocha/zombie tutorials because servers were needed to continue the tutorials
* Hannah, Justyna and Markus finally set up the full stack JavaScript environment(without testing framework). They worked out to actually send data from the user interface to the database which is AMAZING! some more challenges left though, we will work it out tomorrow and carry on building our makersBNB!
